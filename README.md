### Hello Everyone 👋

I'm Carlos Medina, a Software & Web Engineer by Uniovi, where I was also a Lecturer for 4 years (teaching Computer Science Fundamentals and Requirements Engineering). In 2024, I got my PhD with honors (finally!).

All my life, I have been interested in Web Ecosystems and Applications from different points of view. Things like creativity, customer behavior, user experience, metrics, or marketing are things around every success story that must not be forgotten in this tech environment. This passion motivates me to participate in different initiatives, such as Gamelab, an international video games event for industry and business (from 2010 to 2016), or Neozink, a creative design agency to uses technological tools for boosting your business (from 2013 to 2021).

My motivation for using communication for a better understanding of every context made me put a lot of effort into people, and this is the reason why I joined DocPlanner at the beginning of 2022, because I wanted to learn more about different people, cultures, and ways of work. Same with Iktomi, where I was working as Senior Digital Product Manager. In 2024, I joined Inditex as a Senior Engineering Manager to create a better experience in the fashion world.

Additionally, I am or was also responsible for some different projects:
- 🤺 Kendo Vetusta: I am the founder and one of the trainers of the Club. As a 4th Dan of Kendo, I have been training for almost 20 years [kendo-oviedo.com]( Website)
- 🍃 Herbonatura: I am the founder of this e-commerce of products 100% Eco and Natural. It was launched in 2013, and since then, we have received thousands of orders [herbonatura.es](Website)
- 🏋️ Basati CrossFit: I was one of the 4 founders of this initiative in 2018, and after a year of working hard, I left the project because of the distance (300km away from my home)
- 🍯 COLMENA: Was my PhD, a platform that was evolved by some of my fellows later on. It was conceived as a platform to track and monitor students' errors and provide effective feedback from the lecturer's perspective.
- ⚫ Dot is Line: A personal project about empowering leaders to be more authentic, through text messages on social media.
- 💚 Visceral: Project that I founded with my Desirée Cascales, trying to help any person in mindset, body transformation, and personal growth [http://visceral.es/](Website)

My values are Ambition, Curiosity, Charm, Efficiency, and Harmony. They are strongly connected to the mottos: "Protecting My Devotion" and "More is not better. Better is Better". This is because I think that without imagination, anything is possible, and without quality, any idea never grows properly.
